# Call React App Package

##### Author: Juanvidev

Welcome everyone! My fellow developers, this package creates a new react project using vite as a base. Just will ask a few questions and you will have a quick project template to start working on simple react projects. &#127775;

## Usage

Just run the following command inside the folder where you want to create your app with the following command

`npx call-react-app`

There are 4 questions:

- Your app name (required)
- If you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript (required)
- Your desired node version for the project
- A remote github repo url to connect your local and remote repo automatically

Once the script finishes its execution, the project will make an auto-run so you can see the basic features that includes. This template has the following additional features over a react vite project that you will find inside the created project README file.
